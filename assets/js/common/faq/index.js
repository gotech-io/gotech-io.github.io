    question: "How could my business benefit from custom software?",
    answer:
      "A custom business software solution increases your process efficiency through process automation. Through automation, your key resources will be able to better focus on the crucial activities that will add value to your business.

It will keep your business up-to-date, eliminates tedious paper-based and manual processes, and reduces the risk of human errors. Custom solutions can speed up deployment as well as user adoption as it does not demand extensive technical know-how to use and manage a custom application.",
