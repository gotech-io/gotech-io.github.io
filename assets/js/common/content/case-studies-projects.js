        "Both the client-side and server-side systems were outdated.",

    solution:
      "GoTech was able to take ownership of Novotalk's entire system and address their technical challenges. We refactored both the client-side and server-side of the platform, solving numerous performance issues along the way. We also built an entire CI/CD process on AWS, including cost optimizations to help Novotalk save money. Finally, we worked with Novotalk to develop a comprehensive QA testing plan that provided better coverage for their system. Today, GoTech is Novotalk's entire technological team, and we continue to support them as they grow. With our help, Novotalk has been able to improve the performance and reliability of their platform, and is well-positioned for future growth.",
