### Overview

In this seminar we will discuss and learn advanced K8S features. We’ll practice automating and deploying a Kubernetes Cluster with Cluster Monitoring using Terraform for managing the underlay of our Provider (Cloud / VMWARE). We’ll also discuss and test run KOPS and Kubespray for Cloud providers and use Rancher to do everything from building and deploying our K8S cluster to manage and monitor it no matter if our cluster is a Hosted K8S or deployed as a VM.
