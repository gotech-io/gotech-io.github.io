### Overview

he accelerated change is application development is massive.

For years organization developed monolith applications and in less than 10 years we have microservices, cloud native, service mash, serverless, Faas, Dapps, decentralized Cloud and much more.

Heraclitus (Greek philosopher) said, “The Only Thing That Is Constant Is Change -”

We need to embrace change and get ready for it… to do so we need to explore new practices such as Chaos Engineering and more.

The cloud is here for us to BUILD BETTER SOFTWARE but we must understand the state of mind of cloud software in comparison to our current software.
The evolution of software development indicates shifting to Microservices architecture.

But, the infrastructural requirements for the functional Microservice eco-system are very challenging. Therefore, many of the organizations implementing Microservices adapt native cloud computing (private/public / both) in order to take advantage of extreme DevOps and powerful Microservice development environment.

While this architectural change is taking place a new type of application emerges, we call it Dapps, a decentralized application on top of blockchain technology.

In this seminar, we will try to hack this NEW WAY OF MAKING SOFTWARE in all types of cloud platforms by exploring the main architectural and conceptual meaning.
